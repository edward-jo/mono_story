This one‚Äôs a beautiful coming of age story that‚Äôs full of charm. It centres around friendship, science, and humanity.

("Born A Crime by Trevor Noah
One of my favorite audiobooks ever. Love, love, love every second of it. The narrator is the author himself, and he did such an AMAZING job bringing his own story to life. I love the way he explored apartheid, his childhood, and his pathway to becoming the person that he is today through a tone that is hilarious, witty, impactful, and sad all at the same time. You learn so much, and there is not a dull moment in this book. This is the perfect book for if you‚Äôre in a slump (or not.. it‚Äôs the perfect book to pick up anytime really!). It‚Äôs memorable, brilliant, and entertaining. Love it.", 1, "${base20190201.add(Duration(days: random.nextInt(40), seconds: random.nextInt(24 * 60 * 60))).toIso8601String()}", 1);
